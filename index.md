# Work experience 


- 2016-currently: **Hanzehogeschool Groningen**
Institute for Life Science en Technology
    > I am a Senior lecturer of the Biology and Medical Laboratory education program involved in curriculum development. My task is to keep track of the future of the Biological and Medical Research major and to implement new content-related and educational concepts.

- 2009-2016: **Hanzehogeschool Groningen**
Institute for Life Science en Technology
    > I worked as a lecturer of various Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Bio-informatics related modules. 

- 2008-2010: **University Medical Center Groningen**
Center for Liver, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases 
Laboratory Pediatrics 
 
    > I worked as a Postdocteral researcher and investigated the use of nuclear receptors as targets for anti-atherosclerotic therapies in mice. I also generated various pseudo-viral vectors (Adenovirus and  adeno-associated viruses) for gene manipulation.

- 2004-2008: **University of Groningen**
Department of Radiation and Stress Cell Biology

    > I worked as a PhD student on the subject of molecular chaperones and the relation with diseases where proteotoxic stress plays a major role (such as Huntington's Disease). Used various Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and cellular imaging techniques.
    Thesis: [The human HSP70/HSP40 chaperone family, A study on its capacity to combat proteotoxic stress](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/the-human-hsp70hsp40-chaperone-family-a-study-on-its-capacity-to-). 


- 2001-2004: **University of Groningen**
